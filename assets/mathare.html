<h2 id="jijenge">Mathare Slums</h2> 
<img id="child" src="https://emilyjacob.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/slum-3.jpg" width="1490px" height="900px">
     <p>On the eastern side of Nairobi (Kenya's capital city), lies Mathare Valley slums. The slum, one of the oldest in Africa, is home to over half a million households all confined within a mere square kilometer stretch of land. Like in the proverbial animal farm, survival is a daily struggle only reserved for the fittest. </p>
     <p>Livelihood bets on a backdrop of poverty, anarchy, prostitution, lack of basic amenities among a myriad of social complexities. A walk within the slum actually reveals the complex nature of life in Mathare.</p>
     <p>There is absolute inaccessibility to the most basic amenities among them food, water, shelter and healthcare. Road infrastructure is totally not existent. One wonders what would happen in the event of a catastrophic fire outbreak that would require fire engines in the slum.</p>
     <p>Housing is in a pathetic state. Residents have to live within their makeshift structures which also serve as business outlets for the few lucky slum dwellers that operate small-scale businesses. The makeshift shanties are either made of rusty iron sheets, red loam soil or in some cases, polythene walls. </p>
     <p> The dilapidated state of the surrounding environment exposes the residents to the risk of contracting water and food borne diseases. Toilets are considered a luxury. Most residents actually make use of polythene bags to answer to nature calls. Amazingly, these bags are easily spotted among garbage and along footpaths.</p>
     <p>The harsh reality faced by children is necessitated by poverty as nearly all households survive on less than a dollar a day. Left alone to fend for themselves, young girls indulge in prostitution at a tender age, leading to early pregnancies, abortions, and early marriages. Boys, on the other hand, find their way to drug abuse and eventually join terror gangs.</p>
