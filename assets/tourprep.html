    <h2>For convinience, We'd like to recomend you to:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Wear appropriately, good walking shoes/boots and clothes as you will have to walk around the slums.</li>
        <li>Be modest; don’t wear flashy jewels and other accessories.</li>
        <li> Respect people’s privacy. So don’t peep through windows or doors, Always ask for permission before taking a photograph.</li>
        <li>Please ask your tour chaperon consent before taking a picture.</li>
        <li>If your children are coming on the tour, please make sure they can walk easily in a normal pace. If not, make sure you can carry them. Take note that the tour will require a 1 to 2 hours walk.</li>
        <li>Please don’t hand out anything during the tour. So don’t hand out money, sweets, pens, balloons and so on. This can create chaos and quickly may establish the assumption that tourists equal gifts; We will allow you to gift them at designated areas. We will put up some boxes at the end of the tour for donations. If you’d like to bring clothing or other items, we will keep them for you on the bus during the tour, so you’ll be able to donate them after the tour.</li>
        <li>JijengeCommunityTours will not be liable for loss of property, accidents or unforeseen incidents. You will join the tour on your own request and responsibility.</li>
        <li>We will always provide security so that you feel free and relaxed while taking the tour.</li>
        <li>For any concerns and questions please ask our dedicated help team under contact us.</li>
    </ul>
