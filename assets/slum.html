        <h2 id="jijenge">Jijenge Community Slum Tour</h2>
        <p>Jijenge community organizes tours in the most underserved slums in Nairobi namely Kiamaiko, Madoya, Mradi, Mlango, and Ngomongo. Routinely many visitors tend to visit Kibera where every household is served by at least 5 Non-profit Organization. At the above slums you experience poverty unmasked, forgotten human beings and where progress has never been experienced.   
            </p>

        <p>The tour guides are mothers who were born and brought up in those slums, now taking care of their children and those left behind by their relatives, neighbors who died, got incarcerated or varnished without a trace.

     <p>The women will welcome you to their houses to see how they live and those that they take care of who are ravaged by the H.I.V scourge and other ladies.

     <p>Our tours are very safe as they have been embraced by the community.   The security-guards are the reformed youths within the slums, these young men get some of the income and also have become role models to others who they encourage to stay away from the vices.</p>
